#yogurd 1.0.2 (Beta)


yogurd is currently in beta. 

The release version will include the following features:

1. Database integration.
2. Command line arguments.
3. Man page
4. Easy way for users to add and remove medications and doses (via command line arguments and interaction with db).
5. Make file.
6. Brew formulae. 

You can expect the release to happen before the end of August 2018 (I'm in college, this is a side project I'm making for fun.)
